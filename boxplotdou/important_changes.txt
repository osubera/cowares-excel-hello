Changes that will affect to existing users

r985 (2013/11/2)

name.on.axis=TRUE is to show lables by abbreviation (a, b, c, ...).
  Previsously, the value was to show labels by full name.
  To do the same, name.on.axis=NULL or =factor.labels must be specified.
  The default action is unchanged, showing full names.
  The roll of FALSE is unchanged.
  This change is to make the action compatible to factor.labels.
